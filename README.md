# PipeFusion: Displaced Patch Pipeline Parallelism for Inference of Diffusion Transformer Models

[Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14430)

***Facing Sora Era, still investing in NVLink and high-bandwidth networks for Serving long-sequence Diffusion Models? With PipeFusion, PCIe and Ethernet is enough!***

The project provides a suite of efficient parallel inference appoaches for Diffusion Models.
The backend networks of the diffusion model primarily include U-Net and Transformers (DiT). Both of these can be applied to DiT, and some methods can also be used for U-Net.

1. Tensor Parallelism. (DiT, U-Net)
2. Sequence Parallelism, including Ulysses and Ring Attention: (DiT)
3. Displaced Patch Parallelism, named [DistriFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19481): (DiT, U-Net)
4. Displaced Patch Pipeline Paralelism, named PipeFusion, first proposed in this repo. (DiT)

The communication and memory cost of the above parallelism for DiT is listed in the following table. (* indicates comm. can be hidden by computation, but need extra buffer.)

Best Practices:

1. PipeFusion is the best on both memory and communication efficiency. It dose not need high inter-GPU bandwidth, like NVLink. Therefore, it is lowest on latency for PCIe cluster. However, on NVLink, the power of PipeFusion is weakened.
2. DistriFusion is fast on NVLink at cost of large overall memory cost using, and threfore has OOM for high resolution images.
3. PipeFusion and Tensor parallelism is able to generate high resolution images due to their spliting on both parameter and activations. Tensor parallelism is fast on NVLink, while PipeFusion is fast on PCIe. 
4. Sequence Parallelism usually fast than tensor parallelism, but has OOM for 
high resolution images.


##  PipeFusion: Displaced Patch Pipeline Paralelism

### Overview

As shown in the above table, PipeFusion significantly reduces the memory usage and required communication bandwidth, not to mention it also hides communication overhead under the communication.
It is the best parallel approch for DiT inference to be hosted on GPUs connected via PCIe.

The above picture compares DistriFusion and PipeFusion.
(a) DistriFusion replicates DiT parameters on two devices. 
It splits an image into 2 patches and employs asynchronous allgather for activations of every layer.
(b) PipeFusion shards DiT parameters on two devices.
It splits an image into 4 patches and employs asynchronous P2P for activations across two devices.


PipeFusion partitions an input image into $M$ non-overlapping patches.
The DiT network is partitioned into $N$ stages ($N$ < $L$), which are sequentially assigned to $N$ computational devices. 
Note that $M$ and $N$ can be unequal, which is different from the image-splitting approaches used in sequence parallelism and DistriFusion.
Each device processes the computation task for one patch of its assigned stage in a pipelined manner. 

The PipeFusion pipeline workflow when $M$ = $N$ =4 is shown in the following picture.

### Usage

1. install [long-context-attention](https://github.com/feifeibear/long-context-attention) to use sequence parallelism

2. install pipefuison from local.
```
python setup.py install
```

3. Usage Example
In [./scripts/pixart_example.py](./scripts/pixart_example.py), we provide a minimal script for running DiT with PipeFusion.

```python
import torch

from pipefuser.pipelines import DistriPixArtAlphaPipeline
from pipefuser.utils import DistriConfig
from pipefusion.modules.opt.chunk_conv2d import PatchConv2d

# parallelism choose from ["patch", "naive_patch", "pipeline", "tensor"],
distri_config = DistriConfig(
    parallelism="pipeline",
)

pipeline = DistriPixArtAlphaPipeline.from_pretrained(
    distri_config=distri_config,
    pretrained_model_name_or_path=args.model_id,
)

# use the following patch for memory efficient VAE
# PatchConv2d(1024)(pipeline)
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=distri_config.rank != 0)

output = pipeline(
        prompt="An astronaut riding a green horse",
        generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42),
        num_inference_steps=20,
        output_type="pil,
    )
if distri_config.rank == 0:
    output.save("astronaut.png")
```

## Benchmark

You can  adapt to [./scripts/benchmark.sh](./scripts/benchmark.sh) to benchmark latency and memory usage of different parallel approaches.

## Evaluation Image Quality

To conduct the FID experiment, follow the detailed instructions provided in the assets/doc/FID.md documentation.

## Other optimizations

1. Memory Efficient VAE: 

The VAE decode implementation from diffusers can not be applied on high resolution images (8192px).
It has CUDA memory spike issue, [diffusers/issues/5924](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/5924). 
We fixed the issue by split image to conv operator in VAE by splitting the input feature maps into chunks.
